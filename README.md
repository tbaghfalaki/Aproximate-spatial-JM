# Aproximate Bayesian for spatial joint modeling
In this page, the R code for our paper entitled "Approximate Bayesian inference for joint partially linear modeling of longitudinal measurements and spatial time to event data" by Baghfalaki, Ganjali and Martins is available. In this paper, we propose an approximate Bayesian hierarchical model for joint modeling of longitudinal and spatial survival outcomes. For this aim, a conditional auto regressive model is applied for considering spatial effect and a joint partially linear model is also considered to take into account the non-linear effect of time on the longitudinal response. The performance of the method is investigated using some simulation studies. Also, the proposed method is applied to analyze a real HIV/AIDS data extracted from Brazilian states.
